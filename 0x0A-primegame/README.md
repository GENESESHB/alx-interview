Here's a detailed explanation of each line of the given Python code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Prime Game: Determine the winner based on prime number elimination """
```
- `#!/usr/bin/python3`: This is a shebang line that specifies the path to the Python interpreter. It tells the operating system to use Python 3 to execute the script.
- `""" Prime Game: Determine the winner based on prime number elimination """`: This is a module-level docstring that briefly describes the purpose of the script.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if n is prime"""
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if not n % i:
            return False
    return True
```
- `def is_prime(n):`: Defines a function named `is_prime` that checks if a given number `n` is prime.
- `"""Check if n is prime"""`: This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `is_prime` function.
- `for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):`: Loops from 2 to the square root of `n`, rounded down, checking for factors.
- `if not n % i:`: Checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n % i` equals 0, `n` is not prime.
- `return False`: If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating `n` is not prime.
- `return True`: If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating `n` is prime.

```python
def add_prime(n, primes):
    """Add primes up to n"""
    last_prime = primes[-1]
    if n > last_prime:
        for i in range(last_prime + 1, n + 1):
            if is_prime(i):
                primes.append(i)
            else:
                primes.append(0)
```
- `def add_prime(n, primes):`: Defines a function named `add_prime` that adds prime numbers up to `n` to the list `primes`.
- `"""Add primes up to n"""`: This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `add_prime` function.
- `last_prime = primes[-1]`: Gets the last prime number currently in the `primes` list.
- `if n > last_prime:`: Checks if `n` is greater than the last prime number in the list.
- `for i in range(last_prime + 1, n + 1):`: Loops from the next number after `last_prime` up to `n`.
- `if is_prime(i):`: Checks if `i` is prime.
- `primes.append(i)`: If `i` is prime, it is added to the `primes` list.
- `else: primes.append(0)`: If `i` is not prime, `0` is added to the `primes` list as a placeholder.

```python
def isWinner(x, nums):
    """Determine winner based on prime elimination"""
    score = {"Maria": 0, "Ben": 0}
    primes = [0, 0, 2]  # Pre-initialize list with first three primes
    add_prime(max(nums), primes)  # Add more primes if necessary
```
- `def isWinner(x, nums):`: Defines a function named `isWinner` that determines the winner based on prime number elimination.
- `"""Determine winner based on prime elimination"""`: This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `isWinner` function.
- `score = {"Maria": 0, "Ben": 0}`: Initializes a dictionary to keep track of the scores for Maria and Ben.
- `primes = [0, 0, 2]`: Pre-initializes the `primes` list with the first three values, where 0 represents non-prime placeholders.
- `add_prime(max(nums), primes)`: Calls the `add_prime` function to ensure the `primes` list includes primes up to the maximum number in `nums`.

```python
    for round in range(x):
        _sum = sum((i != 0 and i <= nums[round])
                   for i in primes[:nums[round] + 1])
        if (_sum % 2):
            winner = "Maria"
        else:
            winner = "Ben"
        if winner:
            score[winner] += 1
```
- `for round in range(x):`: Loops through each game round.
- `_sum = sum((i != 0 and i <= nums[round]) for i in primes[:nums[round] + 1])`: Calculates the sum of primes up to `nums[round]`.
  - `i != 0 and i <= nums[round]`: Checks if `i` is a prime (not 0) and within the current round limit.
  - `for i in primes[:nums[round] + 1]`: Iterates over the primes up to `nums[round]`.
- `if (_sum % 2):`: Checks if the sum of primes is odd.
- `winner = "Maria"`: If the sum is odd, Maria wins the round.
- `else: winner = "Ben"`: If the sum is even, Ben wins the round.
- `if winner: score[winner] += 1`: Increments the score of the winner.

```python
    if score["Maria"] > score["Ben"]:
        return "Maria"
    elif score["Ben"] > score["Maria"]:
        return "Ben"
    return None
```
- `if score["Maria"] > score["Ben"]:`: Checks if Maria has a higher score than Ben.
- `return "Maria"`: Returns "Maria" as the winner if she has a higher score.
- `elif score["Ben"] > score["Maria"]:`: Checks if Ben has a higher score than Maria.
- `return "Ben"`: Returns "Ben" as the winner if he has a higher score.
- `return None`: Returns `None` if the scores are tied.
